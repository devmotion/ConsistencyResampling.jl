# ConsistencyResampling

*Consistency resampling of calibrated predictions*

## Overview

This Julia package contains an implementation of consistency resampling.[^BS07]

Consistency resampling is a resampling technique that generates a calibrated set of predictions and
corresponding targets from a set of predictions. The procedure consists of two steps:
- predictions are resampled with replacement
- synthetic targets are sampled according to the resampled predictions.
This resampling procedure ensures that the predictions are calibrated for the artificial targets.
